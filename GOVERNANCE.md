# Governance

This document describes the governance process under which the Keptn project will manage this repository.

## Code of Conduct

The Keptn project abides by its [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). 

As a member of the Keptn project, you represent the project and your fellow contributors. We value our community tremendously and we would like to keep cultivating a friendly and collaborative environment for our contributors and users. We want everyone in the community to have positive experiences.

## Meetings

- Keptn currently hosts [weekly community meetings](https://github.com/keptn/community#%EF%B8%8F-community-meetings) that are open to the public. 
- The meetings serve as a primary source to present, discuss, and review PRs that have been merged or are in the process of being merged to the Keptn project. 
- It is strongly suggested and encouraged that offline reviews are undertaken to gauge the group's opinion on the proposed change before the meeting. Comments on the PRs will foster communication and might accelerate and ease the review process.
- During meetings, priority will be given to PRs that appear to need discussion over those that can be handled offline. 
- Not every PR has to be discussed in an online meeting to be merged. 
- Non-substantial PRs (e.g., fixing of typos, small bug fixes) might be processed offline without being mentioned in an online meeting.

## Contributing 

The process of contributing to Keptn is described in the [Contributing document](./CONTRIBUTING.md). We encourage you to take a look at it before opening a PR.

The document explains in detail how to get started, and describes the process for getting your change merged into the Keptn project.

### Keptn Enhancement Proposals

Proposing new functionality for Keptn is a transparent process done via a so-called [Keptn Enhancement Proposal](https://github.com/keptn/enhancement-proposals).
This is required when the proposed functionality is intended to introduce new behaviour, change desired behaviour, or otherwise modify the requirements of Keptn.

If all you want to propose is a simple addition to a Keptn-service or the CLI, or even a bugfix, you can just open [a new issue on GitHub](https://github.com/keptn/keptn/issues/new/choose).

## Membership

The Keptn community membership is defined in the [Keptn Community Membership document](https://github.com/keptn/community/blob/master/community-membership.md). 

The Keptn project maintains three levels of membership with increasing responsibilities. The three levels as well as the requirements are described in more detail in the linked document.

The Keptn project also awards [Keptn community rockstars](https://github.com/keptn/community/blob/master/community-rockstar.md) quarterly. This award does not come with additional responsibilities or additional permissions on the project, it is an appreciation from the Keptn community for individual members that have been showing their excellence in the Keptn community.

## Handling Security Vulnerabilities

The process for handling any security vulnerabilities or concerns found in the Keptn project is described in the [Security document](./SECURITY.md). 

## Releases

A new Keptn version is released once substantial new features, bug fixes, and/or security hardenings have been merged into the master branch, resulting in a non-fixed release schedule. Nevertheless, the Keptn project aims for one major/minor version at least once every 3 months. Patch versions might be released more frequently. Only maintainers can do the releases. The release checklist is maintained on the wiki page [Release Checklist](https://github.com/keptn/keptn/wiki/Release-Checklist).

[Keptn-contrib](https://github.com/keptn-contrib) and [Keptn-sandbox](https://github.com/keptn-sandbox) projects mights have their own independent release process.
