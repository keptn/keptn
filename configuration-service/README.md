# Configuration Service

The *configuration-service* is a Keptn core component and used to manage resources for Keptn project-related entities, i.e., project, stage, and service. The entity model is shown below. To store the resources with version control, a git repository is used that is mounted as persistent volume.  Besides, this service has functionality to upload the git repository to any Git-based service such as GitLab, GitHub, Bitbucket, etc.
