## Report a Vulnerability

We are extremely grateful for security researchers and users that report vulnerabilities to the Keptn Open Source Community. All reports are thoroughly investigated by a set of community members.

To make a report, submit your vulnerability to all security contacts of Keptn [listed below](#security-contacts). This allows triage and handling of the vulnerability with standardized response times.

### When Should I Report a Vulnerability?

- You think you discovered a potential security vulnerability in Keptn
- You are unsure how a vulnerability affects Keptn
- You think you discovered a vulnerability in another project that Keptn depends on. For projects with their own vulnerability reporting and disclosure process, please report it directly there.

### When Should I NOT Report a Vulnerability?

- You need help tuning Keptn components for security - please discuss this is in the various Keptn community channels
- You need help applying security-related updates
- Your issue is not security-related

## Security Vulnerability Response

Each report is acknowledged and analyzed by the security contacts within 5 working days. This will set off the [Security Release Process](#process).

Any vulnerability information shared with the Keptn security contacts stays within Keptn project and will not be disseminated to other projects unless it is necessary to get the issue fixed.

## Public Disclosure Timing

A public disclosure date is negotiated by the Keptn Security Committee and the bug submitter. We prefer to fully disclose the bug as soon as possible once a user mitigation is available. It is reasonable to delay disclosure when the bug or the fix is not yet fully understood, the solution is not well-tested, or for vendor coordination. The timeframe for disclosure is from immediate (especially if it is already publicly known) to a few weeks. For a vulnerability with a straightforward mitigation, we expect report date to disclosure date to be on the order of 7 days. The Keptn Security Committee holds the final say when setting a disclosure date.

## Process

If you find a security-related bug in Keptn, we kindly ask you for responsible disclosure and for giving us appropriate time to react, analyze, and develop a fix to mitigate the found security vulnerability. The security contact will investigate the issue within 5 working days.

The team will react promptly to fix the security issue and its workaround/fix will be [published on our website](https://keptn.sh/docs/news/vulnerability_bulletins/) along with a classification of the security issue.
