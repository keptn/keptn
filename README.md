Keptn is an event-based control plane for continuous delivery and automated operations for cloud-native applications. 
Please find the documentation on our [website](https://keptn.sh), and read the motivation about Keptn on our 
[Why Keptn?](https://keptn.sh/why-keptn/) page.

In addition, you can find the roadmap of the Keptn project [here](https://github.com/orgs/keptn/projects/1). It provides 
an overview of user stories that are currently in the focus of development for the next release.

## Quickstart
To get started with keptn you need a Kubernetes cluster. Supported Kubernetes engines and versions can be found [in the documentation](https://keptn.sh/docs/0.7.x/operate/k8s_support/).  
<br>
Here is a quick guide on how to get started with Keptn on [k3s](https://k3s.io/) on MacOS and Linux:

**Install K3s**  
Download, install and run K3s (tested with versions 1.16 to 1.19):
``` console
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | INSTALL_K3S_VERSION=v1.19.5+k3s1 K3S_KUBECONFIG_MODE="644" sh -s - --no-deploy=traefik
```
**Export the Kubernetes config using:**
``` console
export KUBECONFIG=/etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml
```  

**Download keptn CLI using Bash (e.g., Linux and Mac OS)**:
```console
curl -sL https://get.keptn.sh | bash
```
or download a release for your platform from the [release page](https://github.com/keptn/keptn/releases)


**Install keptn**:
```console
keptn install --endpoint-service-type=ClusterIP --use-case=continuous-delivery
```

You can find documentation on how to get started with Keptn in our [Quick Start Guide](https://keptn.sh/docs/quickstart/) and the [Installation instructions](https://keptn.sh/docs/0.7.x/operate/install/).
