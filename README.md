# keptn
keptn is a fabric for cloud-native lifecycle automation at enterprise scale. In its first version it provides an automated setup of the keptn core components as well as a demo application. Also included are three preconfigured use cases for the demo application: automated quality gates, runbook automation, and automated evaluation of blue/green deployments.
