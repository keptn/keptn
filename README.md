# keptn
keptn is a fabric for cloud-native lifecycle automation at enterprise scale. In its first version it provides an automated setup of the keptn core components as well as a demo application. Also included are three preconfigured use cases for the demo application: automated quality gates, runbook automation, and automated evaluation of blue/green deployments.

## Usage

Here is the best way to getting started with keptn:
- If you want to try out keptn with a predefined application and work through the main use cases that keptn provides, please use the latest 0.1.x release, currently [0.1.2](https://github.com/keptn/keptn/tree/0.1.2). (:warning: 0.1.x version will be obsolete as soon as version 0.2 has been released).
- If you want to try out the latest version of keptn with your own services and application, please use the [0.2.x prerelease branch](https://github.com/keptn/keptn/tree/prerelease-0.2.x) and follow the [pre-release documentation](https://keptn.sh/docs/0.2.0/) on the https://keptn.sh website. We recommend to work with this version.
- If you want to work with the latest version of keptn that is currently under development, please use the master branch. (:warning: this is the development branch, so it might not be stable all the time)
