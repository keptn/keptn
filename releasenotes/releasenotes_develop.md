# Release Notes 0.8.1

Keptn 0.8.1 improves the user experience of Keptn by allowing custom names for SLOs, showing a stage-wide overview of currently running sequences including quality gate evaluations, and offering an API/CLI support to create secrets (on top of *Kubernetes Secrets*). Besides, this release addresses encountered bugs and issues encountered.

---

**Key announcements:**

:tada: *API/CLI support for creating secrets*:  This release introduces the new feature to create a secret on the Keptn control-plane, which is then stored as [Kubernetes Secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/). Therefore, the Keptn API and CLI provide the required functionality. Please see [keptn create secret](https://keptn.sh/docs/0.8.x/reference/cli/commands/keptn_create_secret/) to learn how to use this feature. 

:star: *Bridge improvements for SLO names and stage overview*: The SLO spec allows adding a `displayName` for an SLO. This name is optional but will be used in the Bridge when available; please see the snippet below. Additionally, the Bridge provides enhancements for the environment screen where an overview of the currently running sequences is given and the evaluation of a quality gate is displayed:

          - "<600"

      - criteria:
          - "<=800"

:dizzy: *(UI mockup for the Keptn Uniform) Bridge displays deployed Keptn-services (integrations) and their subscriptions*: In this release, a UI mockup is provided that should provide a look-and-feel on how to display Keptn-services that are connected to the control-plane. To take a look at this mockup, open the Bridge and navigate to: `your.keptn.endpoint/bridge/project/{project_name}/ff-uniform`

Many thanks to the community for the enhancements on this release!
