# Release Notes 0.8.2

Keptn 0.8.2 is a hardening release and incorporates changes that are required to deploy Keptn using Keptn. Besides, the *Sequence* and *Service* screens in the Bridge are improved to provide a holistic view of the services on the one hand, and a clear separation of sequentially executed sequences on the other hand.

---

**Key announcements:**

:cocktail: *Keptn drinks its own champaign*: Each merge on the *master* (aka. main) branch of the keptn/keptn repository triggers a Keptn to deploy this new version into a development environment. This helps the Keptn project to have the latest and greatest version of Keptn running and to do feature presentations using this deployment. 

> A GitHub action has been implemented that allows sending a Keptn event to a Keptn installation: [gh-action-send-event](https://github.com/keptn/gh-action-send-event). Do wait to integrate it into your CI on GitHub today!

:hammer: *Hardening of Keptn*: Containers of Keptn core services are not running as root users and a security context has been defined. *Please note*: Defining the security context for NATS is not possible yet, since we are waiting for a new release containing the PR: https://github.com/nats-io/k8s/pull/222.  

:star: *Service/Sequence screen enhancements*: Instead of listing all sequences that were executed on a service, the *Service* screen now displays the deployments of a service that are currently running in the different stages. Besides, the *Sequence* screen improved in displaying sequences that are executed sequentially in the same stage.

Many thanks to the community for the enhancements on this release!
