# Release Notes 0.6.2

This release provides improvements in working with the Keptn Bridge and API as well as troubleshooting support by creating a support-archive through the Keptn CLI. 

:sparkles: *Keptn Bridge:* To provide a convenient and secure way of working with the Keptn Bridge, the Keptn CLI command: `keptn configure bridge --action=expose` has been introduced. This command allows exposure of the Bridge via Istio or Nginx ingress, depending on what's available. Additionally, basic authentication with a default username and password is provided to secure access.

:rocket: *Keptn API:* Internally used endpoints for retrieving Keptn status information are now accessible through the public API, e.g.:
  * GET `/v1/project` - Returns all projects managed by Keptn.
  * GET `/v1/project/{projectName}` - Returns meta-information about a project.
  * GET `/v1/project/{projectName}/stage` - Returns stages from a project.
  * GET `/v1/project/{projectName}/stage/{stageName}/service` - Returns services from a stage.

:star2: *Troubleshooting support:* The CLI now offers the command: `keptn generate support-archive` that fetches all log files from a Keptn deployment and puts them into an archive. This archive can then be used for troubleshooting without connection to the Kubernetes cluster.

Last but not least, this release addresses limitations and issues in regard to create a Keptn project with a not-initialized Git repo.
