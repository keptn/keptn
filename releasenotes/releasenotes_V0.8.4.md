# Release Notes 0.8.4

*Gain visibility into integrations connected to Keptn* - Keptn 0.8.4 starts to implement the Uniform mockup that has been released/presented with Keptn 0.8.1. This new Bridge screen brings insights into the Keptn-services (aka Integrations) that are connected to a Keptn control-plane, allows troubleshooting by retrieving their error logs, and enables creating/deleting secrets for integrations.

---

**Key announcements:**

:tada: *Troubleshooting support for Integrations*: To support troubleshooting integrations without connecting to the environment that runs them, errors are sent to Keptn and displayed in the Uniform screen of a project.

:star: *Creating/Deleting Secrets for Integrations*: To not rely on the Keptn CLI to manage secrets for integrations, Bridge allows creating/deleting secrets. This is supported for integrations that are running on a Keptn control-plane since the public Keptn API does yet not allow querying secrets.  

:rocket: *Customization of Bridge*: With this release, Keptn Bridge can get a custom *look-and-feel* by providing a custom logo, title, and/or stylesheet. More details on this feature are available [here](https://github.com/keptn/keptn/tree/0.8.4/bridge#custom-look-and-feel).

---

*Note*: If you are a maintainer of an Integration that is hosted on [github.com/keptn-contrib](https://github.com/keptn-contrib) or [github.com/keptn-sandbox](https://github.com/keptn-sandbox), you will receive an issue explaining how to upgrade your integration; especially, the distributor. With this upgrade, your integration will then benefit from the new feature and will be displayed in Keptn Bridge.
