# Release Notes 0.2.1

## New Features

- Improved installation script that verifies each steps of the installation to provide accurate feedback of the installation procedure #250 #285

## Fixed Issues

- Invalid characters in project and service names now detected by keptn CLI #292 
- Error handling in core services #287

## Known Limitations

- Installation currently only on GKE (more platforms to come)

- keptn CLI output not reliably reflecting success/error of keptn services: the CLI only reflects the successful acknowledgment of the CLI command but not its successful execution (will be addressed in #203 #143)
