# Release Notes 0.7.1

Keptn 0.7.1 improves the capabilities of the 0.7.0 release by adding more flexibility to the tasks of installing/operating Keptn, introducing three new CLI commands and improving the UX in the Keptn Bridge. Especially the new feature of installing Keptn in different namespaces is a door opener for various use-cases since multiple Keptn deployments, e.g., one for each team, can be operated on one cluster. 

**The key announcements of Keptn 0.7.1**:

:star2: *More flexibility in installing/operating Keptn*: 
- `keptn install --namespace`: Allows you to specify the namespace to install Keptn in. 
- `keptn upgrade`: Instead of manually executing a K8s job as done by the previous upgrade processes, this CLI command performs the upgrade. 
- Set `root context`: As part of the installation Helm Chart of Keptn, a root context can be specified that allows you to customize the prefix of the API and Bridge endpoint of Keptn. 

:rocket: *New CLI commands*:
- `keptn delete service`: This command will delete a service from a project and *undeploy* the service from the cluster. 
- `keptn get events`: This command is a generic implementation to retrieve Keptn events of any event type.  

:sparkles: *UX improvements in environment screen*: Based on feedback on the features of the Keptn delivery assistant, improvements regarding the user experience of the Keptn Bridge has been implemented.

:tada: *Keptn on OpenShift 4*: Thanks to the work of @marcredhat, Keptn has been successfully tested on an OpenShift 4 cluster. Two assets of this task are provided here: (1) Docu for [Automated install of OpenShift 4.5 and Keptn](https://github.com/marcredhat/crcdemos/tree/master/keptn) and (2) [YouTube - Deploy to OpenShift 4.5 / Service Mesh using Keptn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji03EjFx6CA). 

*Additional note:* Added documentation of [GOVERNANCE](https://github.com/keptn/keptn/blob/0.7.1/GOVERNANCE.md) & [SECURITY](https://github.com/keptn/keptn/blob/0.7.1/SECURITY.md) process
