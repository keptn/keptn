## Known Limitations

- Installation currently only on GKE (more platforms to come)
- Only one GitHub organization can be configured with the keptn server (will be adressed in #210)
- For use cases that require Dynatrace: support for Dynatrace SaaS tenants only (will be adressed in #255)
- keptn CLI output not reliably reflecting success/error of keptn services: the CLI only reflects the successful acknowledgment of the CLI command but not its successful execution (will be adressed in #203 #143)
