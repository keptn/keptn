# Release Notes 0.8.0-rc1

Keptn 0.8 improves the core use cases of continuous delivery and automated operations by implementing the new Shipyard version [v0.2](https://github.com/keptn/spec/tree/0.2.0). This new Shipyard version has been proposed and refined in [KEP 06](https://github.com/keptn/enhancement-proposals/pull/6).

---

**Key announcements:**

:rocket: *Separated and explicit Shipyard-defined processes (aka. task sequences) for continuous delivery / automated remediation*: With this Keptn release, it is possible to have multiple processes (called *task sequences*) within one stage. These task sequences are separated from each other and list the tasks that are triggered sequentially.

:tada: *Support individual tasks in sequences*: It is now possible to add custom tasks to a *task sequence* to address needs of delivery/remediation use-cases that go beyond the opinionated approach Keptn is offering.

:star: *Trigger of a sequence can be configured - allowing multiple parallel stages*: The new Shipyard supports the definition of triggers that launch the execution of a *task sequences*. This helps to make it explicit when a sequence gets triggers. Besides, this linking mechanism allows connecting multiple sequences (of different stages) to listen to the same trigger. Consequently, it is possible to connect multiple stages, which are on the same level, to one preceding stage - as shown below:

:star2: *New types of events*: In course of implement the new Shipyard version in Keptn, the Keptn Cloud-events were streamlined and follow now a common pattern. Basically, Keptn just sends out an event of type: `sh.keptn.event.{task.name}.triggered` and other services react on: 
  * `sh.keptn.event.{task.name}.triggered`      > *sent out by Keptn*
  * `sh.keptn.event.{task.name}.started`        > *sent out by a Keptn-service when starting the tasks*
  * `sh.keptn.event.{task.name}.status.changed` > *sent out by a Keptn-service to inform about a status update*
  * `sh.keptn.event.{task.name}.finished`       > *sent out by a Keptn-service when the task is finished*

:sparkles: *Multi-cluster support*: Based on the implementation of Shipyard v0.2, Keptn - as a control-plane for delivery and remediation - is now capable of serving multiple clusters. This is known as the split between *Control plane* and *Execution plane*. For this use-case, the Keptn project offers to run the helm-service (to deploy) and jmeter-service (to test) on the *Execution plane*. This *Execution plane* can be on a cluster other than the cluster where Keptn is installed. 

:dizzy: *Sequence screen in Keptn Bridge*: The new capabilities of Keptn for dealing with task sequences received a dedicated screen in the Keptn Bridge. This screen provides filtering capabilities and a stage-divided view on the performed delivery or remediation tasks.

**Supporting features:**

:tada: *Query usage statistics of your Keptn*: With this release, it is possible to retrieve usage statistics of a Keptn by using the `/api/statistics/v1` endpoint. This returns the number of events processed in the specified time frame. 

:star2: *Keptn CLI supports multiple Keptn installations*: The new Keptn CLI easies working with multiple Keptns since it recognizes switches between Kubernetes clusters and then asks for switching the context Keptn context too. Consequently, your CLI will be automatically connected to the Keptn running on another K8s cluster.   

:star: *Deployment of custom Helm Charts*: An extension of the helm-service allows to deploy custom Helm Charts meaning that the Helm Chart can contain any custom resource and is not limited to a *Kubernetes service* and *deployment*. *Note:* When using this option, the automatic rollback capability of Keptn is not supported.

:sparkles: *SLI breakdown displayed as a table in Keptn Bridge*: For the quality gates capabilities of Keptn, the SLI breakdown is now displayed as a table given a better overview of the individual results.

## Good to know / Known Limitations

This section lists bugs and limitations that are known but not fixed in this release. They will get addressed in one of the next releases.

- Keptn CLI can not be used for automation due to Kube context check [3208](https://github.com/keptn/keptn/issues/3208)
  - There is a workaround provided, please see [here](https://github.com/keptn/keptn/issues/3208#issuecomment-781982765)
- Creating a project fails on OpenShift due to missing write permissions [2453](https://github.com/keptn/keptn/issues/2453)
- Hovering over the score in an `approval.triggered` events in the Bridge leads to a scroll-up / jump-up in Firefox [#2369](https://github.com/keptn/keptn/issues/2369)
- Remove the functionality to listen to service.create.finished event from helm-service [2989](https://github.com/keptn/keptn/issues/2989)
  - The helm-service does not support listening on `sh.keptn.event.service.delete.finished` events when running on the execution plane. This leads in the limitation that deleting deployed services on the execution plan becomes a manual task. To delete a deployed service, execute: 
    ```
    helm ls -n <NAMESPACE>
    helm delete <HELM_RELEASE> -n <NAMESPACE>
    ```
