# Release Notes v0.1.3

This is a bugfix release of version 0.1.2. It does not add any usecases but fixes a problem that prevented the Dynatrace OneAgent to communicate with the Dynatrace Tenant. This version now uses Istio 1.1, which allows outbound traffic per default.

The updated instructions can be found on the [keptn.sh website](https://keptn.sh/docs/0.1.3/).
