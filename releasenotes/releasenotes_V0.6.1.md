# Release Notes 0.6.1

This release introduces the new and shiny :sparkles: **Keptn's Bridge** :sparkles: - the new Keptn's Bridge is implemented on an Angular and NodeJS stack. An excerpt of its feature set shows: 
* Auto-reload Keptn events 
* Breakdown of an SLO evaluation into SLIs
* Comparison of evaluation results across multiple evaluations
* Eye-catching visuals to highlight noticeable elements
* Deep-link to a Keptn project
* Link to Keptn-deployed services

This release also provides documentation on how to run Keptn on a **Minikube 1.2**. With Minikube, Keptn can be installed on a single-node Kubernetes cluster inside a Virtual Machine (VM) that is hosted locally. Next to Minikube, this release provides documentation on how to run Keptn on **MicroK8s** for the Keptn Quality Gates use-case. This also allows running Keptn as an offline deployment.   

Last but not least, this release addresses known limitations and issues in using Keptn Quality Gates. Thanks to the community for the hints. Also many thanks for the [Keptn Enhancement Proposals](https://github.com/keptn/enhancement-proposals) that were submitted and implemented!
